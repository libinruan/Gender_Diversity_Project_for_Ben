#Gender Diversity Project

###Project lead researchers

Dr. Ben Malin (Minneapolis Fed) and Dr. Soo Lee (U. Maryland) 

###Hypothesis

collaboration allows researchers to observe others' characteristics (i.e., ability, work ethic, etc.) and may thus lower field-specific ability belief (FAB). Those beliefs affect the diversity of a field. 

Why is this interesting? Leslie et al (2015) find that FAB matters for diversity, but what should academics who wish to diversify their fields do about it? Leslie et al conclude by suggesting they should downplay talk of innate intellectual giftedness and instead highlight the importance of sustained effort. The project's finding suggest additional approaches such as encouraging collaboration (say by placing more weight on interactions with students in faculty evaluations).[1]

###Preliminary data cleaning goal

construct a panel data set (over time and across disciplines) of the female share of PhDs (and foreigners, minorities, etc.)
